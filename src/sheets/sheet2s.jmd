**Numerical Analysis MATH50003 (2023‚Äì24) Problem Sheet 2**

**Problem 1** Using dual number arithmetic, compute the following polynomials evaluated at the
dual number $2+œµ$ and use this to deduce their derivative at $2$:
$$
2x^2 + 3x + 4, (x+1)(x+2)(x+3), (2x+1)x^3
$$

**SOLUTION**
(a)
$$
2(2+œµ)^2 + 3(2+œµ) + 4 = 2(4+4œµ) + 6+3œµ + 4 = 18 + 11œµ
$$
so the derivative is 11.

(b) 
$$
(3+œµ)(4+œµ)(5+œµ) = (12+7œµ)(5+œµ) = 60+47œµ
$$
so the derivative is 47.

(c)
$$
(2(2+œµ)+1)(2+œµ)^3 = 
(5+2œµ)(4+4œµ)(2+œµ) = 
(20 + 28œµ)(2+œµ) = 40 + 76œµ
$$
so the derivative is 76.

**Problem 2** What should the following functions applied to dual numbers return for $x = a+b œµ$:
$$
f(x) = x^{100} + 1, g(x) = 1/x, h(x) = \tan x
$$
State  the domain where these definitions are valid.

**SOLUTION**

$$
f(a+ bœµ) = f(a) + b f'(a) œµ = a^{100} + 1 + 100ba^{99} œµ
$$
valid everywhere.

$$
g(a+ bœµ) =  {1 \over a} - {b \over a^2} œµ
$$
valid for $a ‚â† 0$.

$$
h(a+bœµ) = \tan a + b \sec^2 a œµ
$$
valid for $a ‚àâ \{ kœÄ+œÄ/2 : k ‚àà ‚Ñ§\}$.

**Problem 3(a)** What is the correct definition of division on dual numbers, i.e.,
$$
(a + b œµ )/(c + d œµ ) = s + t œµ
$$
for what choice of $s$ and $t$? 

**SOLUTION**

As with complex numbers, division is easiest to understand by first multiplying with the conjugate, that is:
$$
\frac{a+bœµ}{c+dœµ} = \frac{(a+bœµ)(c-dœµ)}{(c+dœµ)(c-dœµ)}.
$$
Expanding the products and dropping terms with $œµ^2$ then leaves us with the definition of division for dual numbers (where the denominator must have non-zero real part):
$$
\frac{a}{c} + \frac{bc - ad}{c^2}œµ.
$$
Thus we have $s = \frac{a}{c}$ and $t = \frac{bc - ad}{c^2}$.

**Problem 3(b)** A _field_ is a commutative ring such that $0 ‚â† 1$ and all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse, i.e.,
there exists $a^{-1}$ such that $a a^{-1} = 1$. Can we use the previous part to define $a^{-1} := 1/a$ to make $ùîª$ a field? Why or why not?

**SOLUTION**

An example that doesn't work is $z = 0 + œµ$ where the formula is undefined, i.e, it would give:
$$
z^{-1} = ‚àû + ‚àûœµ
$$

**Problem 4** Use dual numbers to compute the derivative of the following functions at $x = 0.1$:
$$
\exp(\exp x \cos x + \sin x), \prod_{k=1}^3 \left({x \over k}-1\right),\hbox{ and } f^{\rm s}_2(x) = {1 + {x - 1 \over 2 + {x-1 \over 2}}}
$$

**SOLUTION**


We now compute the derivatives of the three functions by evaluating for $x = 0.1 + œµ$. For the first function we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
&\exp(\exp(0.1 + œµ)\cos(0.1+œµ) + \sin(0.1+œµ)) \\
&=\exp((\exp(0.1) + œµ\exp(0.1))(\cos(0.1)-\sin(0.1)œµ) + \sin(0.1)+\cos(0.1)œµ) \\
&= \exp(\exp(0.1)\cos(0.1)+ \sin(0.1) + (\exp(0.1)(\cos(0.1)-\sin(0.1))+\cos(0.1))œµ) \\
&= \exp(\exp(0.1)\cos(0.1)+ \sin(0.1))\\
&\qquad + \exp(\exp(0.1)\cos(0.1)+ \sin(0.1))\exp(0.1)(\cos(0.1)-\sin(0.1))+\cos(0.1))œµ 
\end{align*}
$$
therefore the derivative is the dual part
$$
\exp(\exp(0.1)\cos(0.1)+ \sin(0.1))(\exp(0.1)(\cos(0.1)-\sin(0.1))+\cos(0.1))
$$

For the second function we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
 \left(0.1+œµ-1\right) \left({0.1 + œµ \over 2}-1\right)\left({0.1 + œµ \over 3}-1\right)
 &=\left(-0.9+œµ\right) \left(-0.95 + œµ/2\right)\left(-29/30 + œµ/3\right) \\
&=\left(171/200 -1.4œµ\right)\left(-29/30 + œµ/3\right)  \\
&= -1653/2000 + 983œµ/600
\end{align*}
$$
Thus the derivative is $983/600$.

For the third function we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
{1 + {0.1+œµ - 1 \over 2 + {0.1+œµ-1 \over 2}}} &=  {1 + {-0.9+œµ \over 1.55 + œµ/2}}\\
&= 1 -18/31 + 2œµ/1.55^2
\end{align*}
$$
Thus the derivative is $2/1.55^2$.
