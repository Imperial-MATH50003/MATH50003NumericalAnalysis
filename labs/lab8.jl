# # Lab 8: V.1 Fourier Expansions and V.2 Discrete Fourier Transform

# This lab explores the practical implementation of Fourier expansions on a computer,
# in particular, via use the periodic Trapezium rule for approximating the Fourier coefficients.
# This has a number of wonderful properties including interpolating data exactly, and
# can be expressed cleanly in terms of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
# We also explore the closely related cousins of the Fourier expansion: the Fourier–Taylor expansion
# (for functions with only non-negative Fourier coefficients) and the Cosine expansion (for even functions).

# 
# **Learning Outcomes**
#
# Mathematical knowledge:

# 1. Computing Fourier coefficients and approximating Fourier expansions.
# 2. Extensions to Cosine expansions and discrete cosine coefficients.
# 3. The relationship between regularity and convergence of Fourier expansions.
# 4. The Discrete Fourier Transform and the Discrete Cosine Transform.
# 5. The interpolatory behaviour of approximate Fourier expansions.

# Coding knowledge:

# 1. The QuadGK.jl package and `quadgk` function for black box numerical integration.
# 2. The FFTW.jl package and the `fft` function for applying the Discrete Fourier Transform fast.


# We first load  packages we need including two new ones, FFTW.jl (for the fast Fourier transform)
# and QuadGK.jl (for black-box numerical integration).

# ## V.1 Fourier Expansions

# Consider the Fourier expansion
# $$
# f(x) = ∑_{k=-∞}^∞ f̂_k {\rm e}^{{\rm i}kθ}
# $$
# and the closely related Fourier–Taylor expansion
# $$
# f(x) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ f̂_k {\rm e}^{{\rm i}kθ}
# $$
# where
# $$
# f̂_k := {1 \over 2π} ∫_0^{2π} {\rm e}^{-{\rm i}kθ} f(x)  {\rm d}x.
# $$
# We will ultimately use the Trapezium rule to compute $f̂_k$ but for now we will use QuadGK.jl
# to get a high-accuracy approximation. QuadGK.jl implements a black-box algorithm for computing
# integrals via `quadgk`, eg.

σ,ε = quadgk(exp, 0, 1) # integrates exp(x) for x ∈ [0,1]

# This returns a 2-tuple, the first argument is an approximation to the integral

@test σ ≈ exp(1)-1

# whilst the second argument is an estimate for the error, which in this case is spot-on:

abs(σ - (exp(1)-1))

# If we give an extra parameter `atol` we can specify the desired accuracy.
# We can thus compute  approximations to the true Fourier coefficients that are accurate
# to $10^{-12}$ via:

fouriercoefficient(f, k) = quadgk(θ -> f(θ)*exp(-im*k*θ), 0, 2π, atol=1E-12)[1]/(2π)
fouriercoefficient(exp, 0)

# We can use this to approximate a finite truncation of the Fourier series
# $$
# fₙ(θ) = ∑_{k=-m}^m f̂ₖ {\rm e}^{{\rm i}kθ}
# $$
# Here we implement this in code for the case of $f(θ) = \exp θ$:

m = 20 # n = 2m+1 Fourier coefficients
f̂ = [fouriercoefficient(exp, k) for k = -m:m]
F = θ -> [exp(im*k*θ) for k = -m:m] # Create the Fourier basis
fₙ = θ -> transpose(F(θ))*f̂ # finite Fourier series
g = range(0, 2π, 1000) # plotting grid
plot(g, exp.(g); label="f")
plot!(g, real(fₙ.(g)); label="Re fₙ(θ)")
plot!(g, imag(fₙ.(g)); label="Im fₙ(θ)")

# Because of symmetry properties the imaginary part is numerically zero.
# But observe also that the approximation overshoots at $0$ and $2π$, something
# known as _Gibb's phenomenon_.

# fₙ(θ) = ∑_{k=-m}^{m-1} f̂ₖ {\rm e}^{{\rm i}kθ}

# with $n = 2m$ Fourier coefficients, where $m = 20$, 
# for $f(θ) = \exp(θ)$, $f(θ) = \exp(\cos(θ))$, and $\exp(\exp({\rm i} θ))$. Is the imaginary part still
# numerically zero?  Does the second example appear to converge at $0$ and $2π$?

# ### V.1.1 Convergence of Fourier series

# Different function have different rates of convergence for their Fourier series,
# which is largely dictated by the rate of decay in their coefficients. We can explore
# how different _regularity_, i.e., the smoothness of the function, influences the rate of decay
# of a Fourier expansion.

# $θ (2π - θ)$ and $θ^2 (2π-θ)^2$ for $k = 1,…,100$. By scaling the $x$- and $y$-axis logarithmically deduce
# experimentally the rate of decay.

## TODO: plot the coefficients for the three functions with different smoothness properties and deduce the rate of decay.


# **Problem 2(b)** Repeat the above for $1/(\cos^2 θ + 1)$ and $1/(25 \cos^2 θ + 1)$, $\exp(\cos θ)$, now only scaling the $y$-axis logarithmically. Is the
# convergence algebraic, exponential, or super-exponential?

# ### V.1.2 Trapezium rule and discrete Fourier coefficients

# Above we use `quadgk` to compute the Fourier integrals, however, this has highly limited the number of coefficients
# we can compute as it becomes prohibitively expensive for large `k`. Instead, we can leverage the Trapezium rule which has
# highly structured error properties for computing Fourier integrals. We can use a modified version of the `trapeziumrule` function
# from Lab 1:

function periodictrapeziumrule(f, n)
    ret = 0.0
    for j = 0:n-1
        ret = ret + f(2π*j/n)
    end
    ret/n
end

f = θ -> exp(cos(θ))
@test periodictrapeziumrule(f, 10) ≈ quadgk(f, 0, 2π)[1]/(2π)

# This satisfies the discrete orthogonality property:

n = 5
k = 3
@test [periodictrapeziumrule(θ -> exp(im*(k-ℓ)*θ), n) for ℓ=-20:20] ≈ [mod(ℓ,n) == mod(k,n) ? 1 : 0 for ℓ=-20:20]

# ### V.1.3 Convergence of Approximate Fourier expansions



# We can use the periodic trapezium rule to compute discrete Fourier coefficients $f̂_k^n$ via:

discretefouriercoefficient(f, k, n) = periodictrapeziumrule(θ -> exp(-im*k*θ)f(θ), n)

# These satisfy the aliasing formula
# $$
# f̂_k^n = ⋯ + f̂_{k-n} + f̂_k + f̂_{k+n} + …
# $$
# which we can verify for this case since $f̂_k$ decays very rapidly:

n = 4
@test discretefouriercoefficient(f, 1, n) ≈  fouriercoefficient(f, 1-2n) + fouriercoefficient(f, 1-n) + fouriercoefficient(f, 1) + fouriercoefficient(f, 1+n) + fouriercoefficient(f, 1+2n)

# **Problem 3** Implement the following function `discretecosinecoefficient(f, k, n)` that implements the discrete Cosine coefficient defined via
# $$
# c_k^n :=  {1 \over n} ∑_{j=1}^n f(θ_j) \cos k θ_j \begin{cases} 1 & k = 0 \\ 2 & \hbox{otherwise} \end{cases}
# $$
# where $θ_j = π(j-1/2)/n$.

# ## V.2 Discrete Fourier Transform

# The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) expresses the map from function values to discrete Fourier coefficients as a matrix:

discretefouriertransform(n) = [exp(-2im*π/n * k*j) for k=0:n-1,j=0:n-1]/sqrt(n)

n = 10
Q = discretefouriertransform(n)
@test Q'Q ≈ I # Q is unitary
θ = [2π*j/n for j=0:n-1]
## Matches the discrete Fourier coefficient:
@test Q/sqrt(n) * exp.(θ) ≈ [discretefouriercoefficient(exp, k, n) for k=0:n-1]


# FFTW.jl gives its own implementation of the DFT (up to multiplication by $\sqrt n$) computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):

@test fft(exp.(θ)) ≈ sqrt(n) * Q * exp.(θ)

# Matrix multiplication is $O(n^2)$ operations whilst the FFT costs $O(n \log n)$ operations, which is
# a substantial speedup.

# -----
# **Problem 4** Use `fft` in the function `specialsum(n)` to construct a vector to compute $[S_n(0),…,S_n(n-1)]$ for
# $$
#    S_n(k) := ∑_{p=0}^∞ {1 \over (k+p n)!}.
# $$

function specialsum(n)
    ## TODO: implement a numerical algorithm using fft to compute [S_n(0),…,S_n(n-1)], fast enough that the test passes

n = 5
@test specialsum(n) ≈ [sum(1/factorial(big(k+p*n)) for p = 0:10) for k=0:n-1]

# ### V.2.1 Trigonometric Interpolation

# An important property of approximate Fourier expansions is that they interpolate the data at the specified grid.
# In the case of the Fourier–Taylor expansion we can observe this by plotting the real (and imaginary) part of the expansion:


g = range(0,2π,1000) # plotting grid
f = θ -> exp(exp(im*θ)) # function with a converging Fourier–Taylor expansion
plot(g, real.(f.(g)); label="exp(exp(iθ))")
n = 4
θ = [2π/n*j for j=0:n-1]
𝐟ₖ = fft(f.(θ))/n
fₙ = θ -> transpose([exp(im*k*θ) for k=0:n-1])𝐟ₖ
plot!(g, real.(fₙ.(g)); label="n = $n")
scatter!(θ, real.(f.(θ)); label=nothing) # we interpolate exactly at the grid points

# This example converges very rapidly (and with `n=6` the two curves would be indistinguishable).
# But the interpolation property is true even for functions where we fail to converge:

f = θ -> exp(θ) # function without a converging Fourier–Taylor expansion
plot(g, real.(f.(g)); label="exp(θ)")
n = 4
θ = [2π/n*j for j=0:n-1]
𝐟ₖ = fft(f.(θ))/n
fₙ = θ -> transpose([exp(im*k*θ) for k=0:n-1])𝐟ₖ
plot!(g, real.(fₙ.(g)); label="n = $n")
scatter!(θ, real.(f.(θ)); label=nothing) # we still interpolate exactly at the grid points

# ------

# **Problem 5(a)** Plot the real part of the approximate Fourier expansion
# $$
# f_{-m:m}(θ) : = ∑_{k=-m}^m f̂_k^n {\rm e}^{{\rm i}kθ}
# $$
# and verify that it interpolates $f(θ) = \exp(θ)$ at the specified grid for $m=5,10,20$. Does the approximation appear to converge?

## TODO: Compare $\exp(θ)$ to its approximate Fourier expansion and describe the observed convergence




# **Problem 5(b)** Consider the approximate cosine expansion
# $$
# f_n(θ) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k^n \cos k θ.
# $$
# Compare $f_n$ and $f$ for  $f(θ) = \exp θ$  and $\exp(\cos(θ))$ on $[0,π]$ for $n = 5, 20$.
# Does the approximate cosine expansion interpolate both functions? Expain how the convergence properties better than Fourier, even for non-even functions.
# Can you explain this phenomena?

## TODO: by plotting the cosine expansion make some observations on the interpolation and convergence
