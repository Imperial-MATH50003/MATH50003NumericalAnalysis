# **Problem 1 (C)** Use second-order divided differences
# with an appropriately chosen $h$ to approximate the second derivative of
# $$
# f(x) = \cos(x^2)
# $$
# at $x = 0.1$ with an error less than $10^{-5}$. Note you are not required to choose a "quasi-optimal"
# value for $h$, as long as your choice achieves the specified accuracy.

# **Problem 2 (B)** Implement powers of dual numbers to a float $(a+bϵ)^c$ and
# to a dual number $(a+bϵ)^{c+dϵ}$, in a way that is consistent with a "dual-extension",
# e.g. if $f(x) = x^{3/2}$ or $f(x) = x^x$ then we want to define the power function so that
# in both cases $f(a + bϵ) = f(a) + bf'(a)ϵ$.
# Hint: for the second part recall $x^y = \exp(y \log x)$ which reduces the problem
# to single-argument functions where the "dual-extension" is easy to define.
