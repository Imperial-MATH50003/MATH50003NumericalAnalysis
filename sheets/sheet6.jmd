**Numerical Analysis MATH50003 (2025–26) Problem Sheet 6**


We explore simple rotations, reflections, and the properties of orthogonal/unitary matrices.
We also see how reflections can be used to introduce zeros into a matrix. This leads to an algorithm for
computing the QR factorisation of a matrix.


We begin with some simple examples of $2 × 2$ rotations:


-----

**Problem 1** What simple rotation matrices $Q_1,Q_2 ∈ SO(2)$ have the property that:
$$
Q_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{5} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},  Q_2 \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{5} \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

We now look for specific examples of Householder reflections. These have the important property that they introduce
zeros below the top entry, a feature that will be used in the development of an algorithm for the QR factorisation:

**Problem 2** Consider the vectors
$$
𝐚 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\qquad\hbox{and}\qquad  𝐛 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2{\rm i} \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Use reflections to determine the entries of orthogonal/unitary matrices $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3$ such that
$$
Q_1 𝐚 = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, Q_2 𝐚 = \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
Q_3 𝐛 = \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

In the notes we discussed properties of orthogonal/unitary matrices.  Here we prove these properties, which will be used
in subsequent proofs. These problems also introduce an important concept of a normal matrix:
one which commutes with its adjoint. Both symmetric and orthogonal/unitary matrices are normal. Note that normal matrices are diagonalisable via unitary matrices (an example of _the spectral theorem_).

**Problem 3(a)** Show for a unitary matrix $Q ∈ U(n)$ and a vector $𝐱 ∈ ℂ^n$ that multiplication by $Q$ preserve the 2-norm: $\|Q 𝐱\| = \|𝐱\|.$



**Problem 3(b)** Show that the eigenvalues $λ$ of a unitary matrix $Q$ are
on the unit circle: $|λ| = 1$. Hint: recall for any eigenvalue $λ$ that there exists a unit eigenvector
$𝐯 ∈ ℂ^n$ (satisfying $\| 𝐯 \| = 1$). 



**Problem 3(c)** Show for an orthogonal matrix $Q ∈ O(n)$ that $\det Q = ±1$.
Give an example of $Q ∈ U(n)$ such that $\det Q ≠ ±1$.
Hint: recall for any real matrices $A$ and $B$ that $\det A = \det A^⊤$ and
$\det(AB) = \det A \det B$.



**Problem 3(d)** A normal matrix commutes with its adjoint. Show that $Q ∈ U(n)$ is normal.



**Problem 3(e)** 
The spectral theorem states that any normal matrix is unitarily diagonalisable: if $A$ is normal then $A = V Λ V^⋆$
where $V ∈ U(n)$ and $Λ$ is diagonal.
Use this to show that  $Q ∈ U(n)$ is equal to $I$ if and only if all its eigenvalues are 1.




-----


We now turn to QR factorisation beginning with an example that can be done by hand. (This example was very delicately chosen; 
so this problem is not examinable but does help to understand how the QR factorisation works and its relationship to the reduced QR factorisation.)


-----



**Problem 4** Use Householder reflections to compute QR and reduce QR factorisations of the matrix
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 \\ 
2 & 4 \\ 
2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}.
$$




-----

Our last two problems concern the uniqueness of the QR factorisation.

----


**Problem 5(a)** Show that every matrix $A ∈ ℝ^{m × n}$ has a  QR factorisation such that the diagonal of $R$ is non-negative.
Make sure to include the case of more columns than rows (i.e. $m < n$). 



**Problem 5(b)** Show that the QR factorisation of a square invertible matrix $A ∈ ℝ^{n × n}$ is unique,
provided that the diagonal of $R$ is positive.
