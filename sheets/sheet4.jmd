**Numerical Analysis MATH50003 (2025–26) Problem Sheet 4**


We investigate how interval arithmetic can be used for computing rigorous bounds
of calculations. This includes both simple arithmetic expressions as well as more complicated
mathematical expressions like computing functions from their Taylor series.  In particular, 
we show that one can compute fairly sharp bounds of $\sin 1$. The lab takes this further and 
implements these computations on a computer, allowing for much higher accuracy rigrouous computations.

In the lectures/notes we also began discussing numerical linear algebra, beginning with a study of
structured matrices. This material is primarily studied in the lab, which investigates the practical implementation.
In this problem sheet we investigate bounding errors in matrix multiplication, tying in with last weeks
content on floating point arithmetic.



We complete the proofs of interval multiplication and
division that were omitted in the notes, and ask for the generalisation
to cases not considered in the notes:

------


**Problem 1** For intervals  $X = [a,b]$ and $Y = [c,d]$ satisfying
$0 < a < b$ and $0 < c < d$, and $n > 0$ prove that
$$
\meeq{
X/n = [a/n,b/n] \ccr
XY = [ac, bd]
}
$$
Generalise (without proof) these formulæ to the case $n < 0$ and to where there are no restrictions
on positivity of $a,b,c,d$. You may use the $\min$ or $\max$ functions.



-----

The next problem computes rigorous bounds on $\sin 1$ using interval arithmetic. We begin with
a very simple arithmetic computation with floating point intervals, corresponding to the first two terms of the Taylor series
of $\sin x$:

----


**Problem 2(a)** Compute the following floating point interval arithmetic
expression assuming half-precision $F_{16}$ arithmetic:
$$
[1,1] ⊖ ([1,1] ⊘ 6)
$$
Hint: it might help to write $1 = (0.1111…)_2$ when doing subtraction.



-----

When using interval arithmetic with a Taylor series we need to not only
compute the errors from floating point rounding, but also the error due to truncating the
Taylor series. The following asks to bound this tail (a computation that does not involve floating
point arithmetic at all):

----


**Problem 2(b)** Writing
$$
\sin\ x = ∑_{k=0}^n {(-1)^k x^{2k+1} \over (2k+1)!} + δ_{x,2n+1}
$$
Prove the bound $|δ_{x,2n+1}| ≤ 1/(2n+3)!$, assuming $x ∈ [0,1]$.



-----

We can finally combine the two sources of error to get a rigorous bound on $\sin 1$.
This builds understanding on what the computer is doing in the related questions in the lab:


-----


**Problem 2(c)** Combine the previous parts to prove that:
$$
\sin 1 ∈ [(0.11010011000)_2, (0.11010111101)_2] = [0.82421875, 0.84228515625]
$$
You may use without proof that $1/120 = 2^{-7} (1.000100010001…)_2$.



-----

Our last problem considers the implementation of matrix multiplication in (idealised) floating point.
In the previous PS we saw we could bound errors in multiplication and addition. Here we apply this result to
relate the error of matrix multiplication to a matrix norm. This demonstrates how one can move away from the technical
details of floating point arithmetic and instead understand errors in terms of more mathematical notions like norms that
do not depend on the particulars of floating point:


-----

**Problem 3** For $A ∈ F_{∞,S}^{n × n}$ and $𝐱 ∈ F_{∞,S}^n$ consider the error
in approximating matrix multiplication with idealised floating point: for
$$
A 𝐱 =  \begin{pmatrix}
⨁_{j=1}^n A_{1,j} ⊗ x_j\\
⋮ \\
⨁_{j=1}^n A_{1,j} ⊗ x_j
\end{pmatrix} + δ
$$
use Problem 8 on PS3 to show that
$$
\| δ \|_∞ ≤ 2 \|A\|_∞ \| 𝐱 \|_∞ E_{n,ϵ_{\rm m}/2}
$$
for $E_{n,ϵ} := {n ϵ \over 1-nϵ}$,
where  $n ϵ_{\rm m} < 2$ and the matrix norm is $\|A \|_∞ := \max_k ∑_{j=1}^n |a_{kj}|$.
