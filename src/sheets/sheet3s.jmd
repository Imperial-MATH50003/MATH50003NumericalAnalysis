**Problem 1** With 8-bit unsigned integers, what is the result for the following computations:
$$
127 ⊕_{256} 200,\quad 2 ⊗_{256} 127,\quad 2 ⊗_{256} 128, \quad 0 ⊖_{256} 1
$$

**SOLUTION**
$$
127 ⊕_{256} 200 = 327\ ({\rm mod} 256) = 71
$$
$$
2 ⊗_{256} 127 = 254
$$
$$
2 ⊗_{256} 128 = 256 \ ({\rm mod} 256) = 0
$$
$$
0 ⊖_{256} 1 = -1  \ ({\rm mod} 256) = 255.

**Problem 2(a)** With 8-bit signed integers, what are the bits for the following: $10, 120, -10$.

**SOLUTION**
We can find the binary digits by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 less than a number
until we reach 0, e.g. $10 - 2^3 - 2 = 0$
implies $10 = (1010)_2$.
Thus the bits are: `00001010`.
Similarly,
$$
120 = 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 = (1111000)_2
$$
Thus the bits are `01111000`.
For negative numbers we perform the same trick but adding $2^p$ to make it positive, e.g.,
$$
-10 = 2^8 - 10 ({\rm mod 2^8}) = 246 = 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^2 + 2 = (11110110)_2
$$
This the bits are: `11110110`.

**Problem 2(b)** With 8-bit signed integers, what is the result for the following computations:
$$
127 ⊕_{256}^{\rm s} 200,\quad 2 ⊗_{256}^{\rm s} 127, \quad 2 ⊗_{256}^{\rm s} 128, \quad 0 ⊖_{256}^{\rm s} 1
$$

**SOLUTION**
The first and 3rd part are somewhat trick questions since $200$ and $128$ aren't representable using
8-bit integers, but if we interpret the problem as modulo arithimetic we have:

$$
127 ⊕_{256}^{\rm s} 200 = 327\ ({\rm mod}^{\rm s} 256) = 71,
$$
$$
2 ⊗_{256}^{\rm s} 127 = 254\ ({\rm mod}^{\rm s} 256) = -2,
$$

$$
2 ⊗_{256}^{\rm s} 128 = 256 \ ({\rm mod}^{\rm s} 256) = 0,
$$

$$
0 ⊖_{256}^{\rm s} 1 = -1  \ ({\rm mod} 256)^{\rm s} = -1.
$$

**Problem 3** What is $π$ to 5 binary places? Hint: recall that $π ≈ 3.14$.

**SOLUTION**
We subtract off powers of two until we get 5 places. Eg we have
$$
π = 3.14… = 2 + 1.14… = 2 + 1 + 0.14… = 2 + 1 + 1/8 + 0.016… = 2 + 1 + 1/8  + 1/64  + 0.000…
$$
Thus we have $π = (11.001001…)_2$. The question is slightly ambiguous whether we want to round
to 5 digits so either `11.00100` or `11.00101` would be acceptable.

**Problem 4** What are the single precision $F_{32} = F_{127,8,23}$ floating point representations for the following: 
$$
2, \quad 31, \quad 32, \quad 23/4, \quad (23/4)\times 2^{100}
$$

**SOLUTION**
Recall that we have `σ,Q,S = 127,8,23`. Thus we write
$$
2 = 2^{128-127} * (1.00000000000000000000000)_2
$$
The exponent bits are those of
$$
128 = 2^7 = (10000000)_2
$$
Hence we get the bits 
```
0 10000000 00000000000000000000000
```
We write
$$
31 = (11111)_2 = 2^{131-127} * (1.1111)_2
$$
And note that $131 = (10000011)_2$ Hence we have the bits
```
0 10000011 11110000000000000000000
```

On the other hand,
$$
32 = (100000)_2 = 2^{132-127}
$$
and $132 = (10000100)_2$ hence we have the bits 
```
0 10000100 00000000000000000000000
```
Note that
$$
23/4 = 2^{-2} * (10111)_2 = 2^{129-127} * (1.0111)_2
$$
and $129 = (10000001)_2$ hence we get:
```
0 10000001 01110000000000000000000
```
Finally,
$$
23/4 * 2^{100} = 2^{229-127} * (1.0111)_2
$$
and $229 = (11100101)_2$ giving us:
```
0 11100101 01110000000000000000000
```

**Problem 5** Let $m(y) = \min\{x \in F_{32} : x > y \}$ be the smallest single precision number
greater than $y$. What is $m(2) - 2$ and $m(1024) - 1024$? 

**SOLUTION**
The next float after $2$ is $2 * (1 + 2^{-23})$ hence we get $m(2) - 2 = 2^{-22}$:
```julia
nextfloat(2f0) - 2, 2^(-22)
```
similarly, for $1024 = 2^{10}$ we find that the difference $m(1024) - 1024$ is $2^{10-23} = 2^{-13}$:
```julia
 nextfloat(1024f0) - 1024, 2^(-13)
```
