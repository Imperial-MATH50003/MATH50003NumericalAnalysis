**Problem 1** For intervals  $X = [a,b]$ and $Y = [c,d]$ satisfying
$0 < a < b$ and $0 < c < d$, and $n > 0$ prove that
$$
\meeq{
X/n = [a/n,b/n] \ccr
XY = [ac, bd]
}
$$
Generalise (without proof) these formulæ to the case $n < 0$ and to where there are no restrictions
on positivity of $a,b,c,d$. You may use the $\min$ or $\max$ functions.




**Problem 2(a)** Compute the following floating point interval arithmetic
expression assuming half-precision $F_{16}$ arithmetic:
$$
[1,1] ⊖ ([1,1] ⊘ 6)
$$
Hint: it might help to write $1 = (0.1111…)_2$ when doing subtraction.




**Problem 2(b)** Writing
$$
\sin\ x = ∑_{k=0}^n {(-1)^k x^{2k+1} \over (2k+1)!} + δ_{x,2n+1}
$$
Prove the bound $|δ_{x,2n+1}| ≤ 1/(2n+3)!$, assuming $x ∈ [0,1]$.




**Problem 2(c)** Combine the previous parts to prove that:
$$
\sin 1 ∈ [(0.11010011000)_2, (0.11010111101)_2] = [0.82421875, 0.84228515625]
$$
You may use without proof that $1/120 = 2^{-7} (1.000100010001…)_2$.

**Problem 3** For $A ∈ F_{∞,S}^{n × n}$ and $𝐱 ∈ F_{∞,S}^n$ consider the error
in approximating matrix multiplication with idealised floating point: for
$$
A 𝐱 =  \begin{pmatrix}
⨁_{j=1}^n A_{1,j} ⊗ x_j\\
⋮ \\
⨁_{j=1}^n A_{1,j} ⊗ x_j
\end{pmatrix} + δ
$$
use Problem 8 on PS3 to show that
$$
\| δ \|_∞ ≤ 2 \|A\|_∞ \| 𝐱 \|_∞ E_{n,ϵ_{\rm m}/2}
$$
for $E_{n,ϵ} := {n ϵ \over 1-nϵ}$,
where  $n ϵ_{\rm m} < 2$ and the matrix norm is $\|A \|_∞ := \max_k ∑_{j=1}^n |a_{kj}|$.
