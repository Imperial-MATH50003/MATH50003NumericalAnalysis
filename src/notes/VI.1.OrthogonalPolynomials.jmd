# Orthogonal Polynomials

Fourier series are very powerful for approximating periodic functions.
If periodicity is lost, however, the Fourier coefficients are no longer in $ℓ^1$ and uniform convergence is lost.
In this chapter
we introduce _Orthogonal Polynomials (OPs)_ are more effective for computing with
non-periodic (but still continuous/differentiable) functions. That is we consider expansions of the form
$$
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^∞ c_k p_k(x)
$$
where $p_k(x)$ are special families of polynomials and $c_k$ are expansion coefficients.
The approximation of the coefficients $c_k ≈ c_k^n$ using quadrature will be explored later.

Why not use monomials as in Taylor series? Hidden in the discussion on Fourier series was that we could effectively
compute Taylor coefficients by evaluating on the unit circle in the complex plane, _only_ if the radius of convergence
was 1. Many functions are smooth on say $[-1,1]$ but have non-convergent Taylor series, e.g.:
$$
{1 \over 25x^2 + 1}
$$
While orthogonal polynomials span the same space as monomials, orthogonal polynomials are _much_ more stable and can effectively and accurately
approximate such functions. In particular, where we saw that interpolation
by monomials at evenly spaced points performed horribly in practice we can use orthogonal polynomials
with specially chosen points to get reliable interpolation of functions. 



In addition to numerics, OPs play a very important role in many mathematical areas
including functional analysis, integrable systems, singular integral equations,
complex analysis, and random matrix theory.


## General properties

**Definition (graded polynomial basis)**
A set of polynomials $\{p_0(x), p_1(x), … \}$ is _graded_ if $p_n$ is
precisely degree $n$: i.e.,
$$
p_n(x) = k_n x^n + k_n^{(1)} x^{n-1} + ⋯ + k_n^{(n-1)} x + k_n^{(n)}
$$
for $k_n ≠ 0$.
∎

Note that if $p_n$ are graded then $\{p_0(x), …, p_n(x) \}$
are a basis of all polynomials of degree $n$.


**Definition (Orthogonal Polynomials)**
Given an (integrable) _weight_ $w(x) > 0$ for $x ∈ (a,b)$,
which defines a continuous inner product
$$
⟨f,g⟩ = ∫_a^b  f(x) g(x) w(x) {\rm d} x
$$
a graded polynomial basis $\{p_0(x), p_1(x), … \}$
are _orthogonal polynomials (OPs)_ if
$$
⟨p_n,p_m⟩ = 0
$$
whenever $n ≠ m$. We assume through that integrals of polynomials are finite:
$$
∫_a^b  x^k w(x) {\rm d} x < ∞.
$$
∎


Note in the above
$$
h_n := ⟨p_n,p_n⟩ = \|p_n\|^2 = ∫_a^b  p_n(x)^2 w(x) {\rm d} x > 0.
$$

Multiplying any orthogonal polynomial by a nonzero constant necessarily is also an orthogonal
polynomial. We have two standard normalisations:


**Definition (Orthonormal Polynomials)**
A set of orthogonal polynomials $\{q_0(x), q_1(x), … \}$
are _orthonormal_ if $\|q_n\| = 1$.
∎

**Definition (Monic Orthogonal Polynomials)**
A set of orthogonal polynomials $\{π_0(x), π_1(x), … \}$
are _monic_ if $k_n = 1$.
∎


**Proposition (existence)** Given a weight $w(x)$, monic orthogonal polynomials
exist.

**Proof**
Existence follows immediately from the Gram–Schmidt procedure. That is,
define $π_0(x) := 1$ and
$$
π_n(x) := x^n - ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} {⟨x^n,π_k⟩ \over \|π_k\|^2} π_k(x).
$$
Assume $π_m$ are monic OPs for all $m < n$. Then we have
$$
⟨π_m, π_n⟩ = ⟨π_m, x^n ⟩ - ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} {⟨x^n,π_k⟩ \over \|π_k\|^2} \underbrace{⟨π_m, π_k⟩}_{= 0 \hbox{ if $m ≠ k$}}  = ⟨π_m, x^n ⟩ - ⟨x^n,π_m⟩ = 0.
$$

∎


We are primarly concerned with the usage of orthogonal polynomials in
approximating functions. First we observe the following:

**Proposition (expansion)**
If $r(x)$ is a degree $n$ polynomial and $\{p_n\}$ are orthogonal then
$$
r(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n {⟨p_k,r⟩ \over \|p_k\|^2} p_k(x).
$$
Note for $\{q_n\}$ orthonormal we have
$$
r(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n ⟨q_k,r⟩ q_k(x).
$$

**Proof**
Because $\{p_0,…,p_n \}$ are a basis of polynomials we can
write
$$
r(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n r_k p_k(x)
$$
for constants $r_k ∈ ℝ$.
By linearity we have
$$
⟨p_m,r⟩ = ∑_{k=0}^n r_k ⟨p_m,p_k⟩= r_m ⟨p_m,p_m⟩
$$
which implies that $r_m = ⟨p_m,r⟩/⟨p_m,p_m⟩$.
∎

**Corollary (zero inner product)**
If a degree $n$ polynomial $r$ satisfies
$$
0 = ⟨p_0,r⟩ = … = ⟨p_n,r⟩
$$
then $r = 0$.

**Proof**
If all the inner products are zero the coefficients in the expansion are all zero and $r$ is zero.
∎

**Corollary (uniqueness)**
Monic orthogonal polynomials are unique.

**Proof**
If $p_n(x)$ and $π_n(x)$ are both monic orthogonal polynomials
then $r(x) = p_n(x) - π_n(x)$ is degree $n-1$ but satisfies
$$
⟨r, π_k⟩ = ⟨p_n, π_k⟩ - ⟨π_n, π_k⟩ = 0
$$
for $k = 0,…,{n-1}$. Note $⟨p_n, π_k⟩ = 0$ can be seen by
expanding
$$
π_k(x) = ∑_{j=0}^k c_j p_j(x).
$$
∎


OPs are uniquely defined (up to a constant) by the
property that they are orthogonal to all lower degree polynomials.

**Theorem (orthogonal to lower degree)**
Given a weight $w(x)$,
a polynomial
$$
p(x) = k_n x^n + O(x^{n-1})
$$
with $k_n ≠ 0$ satisfies
$$
⟨p,f_m⟩ = 0
$$
for all  polynomials $f_m$ of degree $m < n$ if and only if
$p(x) = k_n π_n(x)$ where $π_n(x)$ are the monic orthogonal polynomials.
Therefore an orthogonal polynomial is uniquely
defined by the weight and leading order coefficient $k_n$.

**Proof**
We leave this proof to the problem sheets.
∎




## Three-term recurrence

The most _fundamental_ property of orthogonal polynomials is their three-term
recurrence.

**Theorem (3-term recurrence, 2nd form)**
If $\{p_n\}$ are OPs then there exist real constants
$a_n b_n, c_{n-1}$
such that
$$
\begin{align*}
x p_0(x) &= a_0 p_0(x) + b_0 p_1(x)  \\
x p_n(x) &= c_{n-1} p_{n-1}(x) + a_n p_n(x) + b_n p_{n+1}(x),
\end{align*}
$$
where $b_n ≠0$ and $c_{n-1} ≠0$.
**Proof**
The $n=0$ case is immediate since $\{p_0,p_1\}$ are a basis of degree 1 polynomials.
The $n >0$ case follows from
$$
⟨x p_n, p_k⟩ = ⟨ p_n, xp_k⟩ = 0
$$
for $k < n-1$ as $x p_k$ is of degree $k+1 < n$.

Note that
$$
b_n = {⟨p_{n+1}, x p_n⟩ \over \|p_{n+1} \|^2} ≠ 0
$$
since $x p_n = k_n x^{n+1} + O(x^n)$ is precisely degree
$n$. Further,
$$
c_{n-1} = {⟨p_{n-1}, x p_n⟩ \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } =
{⟨p_n, x p_{n-1}⟩  \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } =  b_{n-1}{\|p_n\|^2  \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } ≠ 0.
$$



∎




Clearly if $π_n$ is monic then so is $x π_n$ which leads to the following:

**Corollary (monic 3-term recurrence)** $\{π_n\}$ are monic if and only if $b_n =  1$.
**Proof**

If $b_n = 1$ and $π_n(x) = x^n + O(x^{n-1})$ then the 3-term recurrence shows us that
$$
π_{n+1}(x) = x π_n(x) - c_{n-1} π_{n-1}(x) - a_n π_n(x) = x^{n+1} + O(x^n)
$$
and $π_{n+1}(x)$ is also monic. Similarly, if $π_n(x)$ is monic and $b_n ≠ 1$ then $π_{n+1}(x)$ is not
monic, which would be a contradiction.
∎


Note this implies that we can define $π_{n+1}(x)$ in terms of $π_{n-1}$ and $π_n$:
$$
π_{n+1}(x) = x π_n(x) - a_n π_n(x) - c_{n-1} π_{n-1}(x)
$$
where
$$
a_n = {⟨x π_n, π_n⟩ \over \| π_n\|^2} \qquad \hbox{and} \qquad c_{n-1} = {⟨x π_n, π_{n-1}⟩ \over \| π_{n-1}\|^2}.
$$


**Example (constructing OPs)** What are the  monic OPs $π_0(x),…,π_3(x)$ with respect to $w(x) = 1$ on $[0,1]$?
We can construct these using Gram–Schmidt, but exploiting the 3-term recurrence to reduce the computational cost.
We have $π_0(x) = 1$, which we see is already normalised:
$$
\|π_0\|^2 = ⟨π_0,π_0⟩ = ∫_0^1 {\rm d} x = 1.
$$
We know from the 3-term recurrence that
$$
x π_0(x) = a_0 π_0(x) +  π_1(x)
$$
where
$$
a_0 = {⟨π_0,x π_0⟩  \over \|π_0\|^2} = ∫_0^1 x {\rm d} x = 1/2.
$$
Thus
$$
\begin{align*}
π_1(x) = x π_0(x) - a_0 π_0(x) = x-1/2 \qquad  ⇒ \\
\|π_1\|^2 = ∫_0^1 (x^2 - x + 1/4) {\rm d} x = 1/12.    
\end{align*}
$$
From
$$
x π_1(x) = c_0 π_0(x) + a_1 π_1(x) +  π_2(x)
$$
we have
$$
\begin{align*}
c_0 &= {⟨π_0,x π_1⟩  \over \|π_0\|^2} = ∫_0^1 (x^2 - x/2) {\rm d} x = 1/12, \\
a_1 &= {⟨π_1,x π_1⟩  \over \|π_1\|^2} = 12 ∫_0^1 (x^3 - x^2 + x/4) {\rm d} x = 1/2, \\
π_2(x) &= x π_1(x) - c_0 - a_1 π_1(x) = x^2 - x + 1/6 \qquad ⇒ \\
\|π_2\|^2 &= \int_0^1 (x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2/3 - x/3 + 1/36) {\rm d} x = {1 \over 180}
\end{align*}
$$
Finally, from
$$
x π_2(x) = c_1 π_1(x) + a_2 π_2(x) +  π_3(x)
$$
we have
$$
\begin{align*}
c_1 &= {⟨π_1,x π_2⟩  \over \|π_1\|^2} = 12 ∫_0^1 (x^4 - 3x^3/2 +2x^2/3 -x/12)  {\rm d} x = 1/15, \\
a_2 &= {⟨π_2,x π_2⟩  \over \|π_2\|^2} = 180 ∫_0^1 (x^5 - 2x^4 +4x^3/3 - x^2/3 + x/36) {\rm d} x = 1/2, \\
π_3(x) &= x π_2(x) - c_1 π_1(x)- a_2 π_2(x) \ccr 
= x^3 - x^2 + x/6 - x/15 + 1/30 -x^2/2 + x/2 - 1/12 \\
&= x^3 - 3x^2/2 + 3x/5 -1/20
\end{align*}
$$
∎

## Jacobi matrices


The three-term recurrence can also be interpreted as a matrix:

**Corollary (multiplication matrix)**
For
$$
P(x) := [p_0(x) | p_1(x) | ⋯]
$$
then we have
$$
x P(x) = P(x) \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} a_0 & c_0 \\
                                                        b_0 & a_1 & c_1\\
                                                        & b_1 & a_2 & ⋱ \\
                                                        && ⋱ & ⋱
                                                        \end{bmatrix}}_X
$$
More generally, for any polynomial $a(x)$ we have
$$
a(x) P(x) = P(x) a(X).
$$

**Proof**
The expression follows:
$$
x P(x) = [xp_0(x) | xp_1(x) | ⋯] =
[a_0p_0(x) + b_0 p_1(x) | c_0 p_0(x) + a_1 p_1(x) + b_1 p_2(x) | ⋯] = P(x) X.
$$
For polynomials, note that
$$
x^k P(x) = x^{k-1} P(x) X = ⋯ = P(x) X^k.
$$
Thus if $a(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k x^k$ we have by linearity
$$
a(x) P(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k x^k P(x) = P(x) ∑_{k=0}^n a_k X^k = P(x) a(X).
$$
∎

**Remark** If you are worried about multiplication of infinite matrices/vectors
note it is well-defined by the standard definition because it is banded.
It can also be defined in terms of functional analysis where one considers these
as linear operators (functions of functions) between vector spaces.


For the special cases of orthonormal polynomials we have extra structure,
in which case we refer to the matrix as a _Jacobi matrix_:

**Corollary (Jacobi matrix)**
The multiplication matrix of a family of orthogonal polynomials $p_n(x)$ is symmetric,
$$
X = X^⊤ = \begin{bmatrix} a_0 & b_0 \\
                                                        b_0 & a_1 & b_1\\
                                                        & b_1 & a_2 & ⋱ \\
                                                        && ⋱ & ⋱
                                                        \end{bmatrix},
$$
if and only if $p_n(x)$ is up-to-sign a fixed constant scaling of orthonormal:
for $q_n(x) := π_n(x)/\|π_n\|$ we have for a fixed $α ∈ ℝ$ and $s_n ∈ \{-1,1\}$
$$
p_n(x) = α s_n q_n(x).
$$

**Proof**
First, assume $p_n(x)$ has the specified form. Noting that $\|q_n\|^2 = 1$ and thence $\|p_n\|^2 = α^2$,
if $p_n(x) = α s_n q_n(x)$ we have
$$
b_n = {⟨xp_n, p_{n+1}⟩ \over \|p_{n+1}\|^2} = s_n s_{n+1} ⟨x q_n, q_{n+1}⟩ =
s_n s_{n+1} ⟨q_n, x q_{n+1}⟩ = {⟨p_n, xp_{n+1}⟩ \over \|p_n\|^2} = c_{n}
$$
and therefore $X$ is symmetric.

Conversely, suppose $X = X^⊤$, i.e., $b_n = c_{n}$ and write the corresponding
orthogonal polynomials as $p_n(x) = α_n q_n(x)$. We have
$$
\meeq{
b_n = {⟨xp_n, p_{n+1}⟩ \over \|p_{n+1}\|^2} =
{α_n \over α_{n+1}} ⟨xq_n, q_{n+1}⟩ =
{α_n \over α_{n+1}} ⟨q_n, x q_{n+1}⟩ = {α_n^2 \over α_{n+1}^2} {⟨p_n, xp_{n+1}⟩ \over \|p_n\|^2}
\ccr
= {α_n^2 \over α_{n+1}^2} c_{n} = {α_n^2 \over α_{n+1}^2} b_n.
}
$$
Hence $α_n^2 = α_{n+1}^2$ which implies that $α_{n+1} = ± α_n$. By induction the result follows,
where $α := α_0$.
∎


**Remark** Every compactly supported integrable weight generates a family of
orthonormal polynomials, which in turn generates a Jacobi matrix.
There is a “Spectral Theorem for Jacobi matrices" that says one can go the
other way: every tridiagonal symmetric matrix with bounded entries is a Jacobi
matrix for some integrable weight with compact support. This is an example of what
[Barry Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Simon) calls a “Gem of spectral theory".


**Example (uniform weight orthonormal polynomials)** Consider computing orthonormal polynomials 
with respect to $w(x) = 1$ on $[0,1]$. Above we constructed the monic OPs $π_0(x),…,π_3(x)$ so we
can deduce the orthonormal polynomials by dividing by their norm, but there is another way: writing 
$q_n(x) = k_n π_n(x)$, find the
normalisation $k_n$ that turns the 3-term recurrence into a symmetric matrix. 
We can write the 3-term recurrence coefficients for monic OPs as a multiplication matrix:
$$
x [π_0(x)| π_1(x)| ⋯] = [π_0(x)| π_1(x)| ⋯] \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/12 \\
                                                            1 & 1/2 & 1/15 \\
                                                            & 1 & 1/2 & ⋱ \\
                                                            & & 1 & ⋱ & ⋱ \\
                                                            &&& ⋱ \end{bmatrix}}_X
$$
The previous theorem says that if we rescale the polynomials so that the resulting Jacobi matrix is
symmetric than they are by necessity the orthonormal polynomials. In particular, consider writing:
$$
[q_0(x) | q_1(x) | ⋯] = [π_0(x)| π_1(x)| ⋯] \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}  k_0 \\ & k_1 \\ && k_2 \\ &&& ⋱ \end{bmatrix}}_K
$$
where we want to find the normalisation constants. Since $\|π_0\| = 1$ we know $k_0 = 1$. We have
$$
x [q_0(x) | q_1(x) | ⋯] = [π_0(x)| π_1(x)| ⋯] X K = [q_0(x) | q_1(x) | ⋯] \underbrace{K^{-1} X K}_{J}
$$
where
$$
J = \begin{bmatrix} a_0 & c_0 k_1 \\
                         k_1^{-1} & a_1 & c_1 k_2/k_1 \\
                         & k_1/k_2 & a_2 & c_2 k_3/k_2 \\
                         &&⋱ & ⋱ & ⋱ \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Thus for this to be symmetric we need
$$
c_0 k_1 = k_1^{-1}, c_1 k_2/k_1 = k_2^{-1}, c_2 k_3/k_2 = k_3^{-1}, …
$$
Note that
$$
c_2 = {⟨π_2,x π_3⟩  \over \|π_2\|^2} = 180 ∫_0^1 (x^6 -5x^5/2 + 34x^4/15 - 9x^3/10 + 3x^2/20 - x/120){\rm d} x = 9/140.
$$
Thus we have (noting that the $k_n$ are all positive which simplifies the square-roots):
$$
\meeq{
k_1 = 1/\sqrt{c_0} = 2\sqrt{3}, \ccr
k_2 = k_1/\sqrt{c_1} = 6\sqrt{5}, \ccr
k_3 =  k_2/\sqrt{c_2} = 20 \sqrt{7}.
}
$$
Thus we have
$$
\begin{align*}
q_0(x) &= π_0(x) = 1, \\
q_1(x) &= 2\sqrt{3} π_1(x)= \sqrt{3} (2  x - 1), \\
q_2(x) &= 6\sqrt{5} π_2(x) = \sqrt{5} (6x^2 - 6x + 1), \\
q_3(x) &= 20 \sqrt{7} π_3(x) = \sqrt{7} (20x^3-30x^2 + 12x - 1),
\end{align*}
$$
which have the Jacobi matrix
$$
\begin{align*}
J =
     \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/(2\sqrt{3}) \\
                    1/(2\sqrt{3}) & 1/2 &  1/\sqrt{15} \\
                    & 1/\sqrt{15} & 1/2 & 3/(2 \sqrt{35}) \\
                    && 3/(2 \sqrt{35}) &  1/2 & ⋱ \\
                    &&& & ⋱ & ⋱ \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
$$
∎


**Example (expansion via Jacobi matrix)** What are the expansion coefficients of $x^3 - x + 1$ in $\{q_n\}$? We could
deduce this by computing the inner products though its actually simpler to use the multiplication matrix. In particular if we write
$$
Q(x) := [q_0(x) | q_1(x) | q_2(x) | ⋯]
$$
Then we have (note: $q_0(x) ≡ 1$ only because the weight integrates to 1) $1 = Q(x) 𝐞_1$.
This tells us that:
$$
x = x Q(x) 𝐞_1 = Q(x) X 𝐞_1 = Q(x) \Vectt[1/2, 1/(2\sqrt{3}), 0, ⋮].
$$
Continuing we have
$$
\meeq{
x^2 = Q(x)  X \Vectt[1/2, 1/(2\sqrt{3}), 0, ⋮] = Q(x) \Vectt[1/3, 1/(2 \sqrt{3}),  1/(6\sqrt{5}),0,⋮ ] \ccr
x^3 = Q(x) X  \Vectt[1/3, 1/(2 \sqrt{3}),  1/(6\sqrt{5}),0,⋮ ] =
 Q(x) \Vectt[1/4,{3 \sqrt{3} \over 20}, {1 \over 4 \sqrt{5}}, {1 \over 20 \sqrt{7}}, 0, ⋮]
}
$$
Thus by linearity we find that
$$
\meeq{
x^3 - x + 1 = Q(x) \Vectt[3/4, -1/(20\sqrt{3}), {1 \over 4 \sqrt{5}}, {1 \over 20 \sqrt{7}}, 0, ⋮] \ccr
= {3 \over 4} q_0(x) - {1 \over 20\sqrt{3}} q_1(x) + {1 \over 4 \sqrt{5}} q_2(x) + {1 \over 20 \sqrt{7}} q_3(x).
}
$$
